# Practical examples using vanilla javascript and web apis

## Goals

* Use latest ES6 features without requiring any bundle
* No JS dependencies in the client side
* Use native WEB APIs

## Conclusions so far
1. ES6 support in Chrome >80 is really nice! I haven't needed any bundler so far.
2. [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) rules! It's been pretty straigthforward to create new components, and it's nice you can import css files and apply classes to elements within a shadow element of a web component, without affecting other web components, so that encapsulation is impressive.
3. This excersice opened my eyes, and I used to take for granted that it's super easy to import any state manager, orany other tool which makes you forget about basic stuff of any application, so I respect more all developers who contribute to OSS, whatever the library, big/small all authors/contributors of OSS rock!.
